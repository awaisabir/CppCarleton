# comp2404
My collection of what was done for COMP2404 (Intro to Software Engineering) at Carleton University. This course was solely written in C++. It was taught by Professor Christine Laurendeau. It taught me the basics and some advanced concepts in C++. Feel free to look at my projects.

  All projects were made according to the instructions of our professor, and the sample code was given for A1. Rest of the assignments were worked on by myself.



#Assignment 1/A1

  The purpose for this assignment was to change all the already existing objects in the Bookstore Management System's base code present by Professor Christine Laurendeau, to dynamically allocated objects.
  
#Assignment 2/A2

  The purpose of this assignment was to implement a dynamically allocated doubly-linked list for the "Courses" section of the existing Bookstore Management Sytem. The add, remove and list features were to be implemented as that of a standard doubly-linked list, instead of the previous array-style setup of A1.
  
#Assignment 3/A3
