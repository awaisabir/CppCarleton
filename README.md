# Software Engineering 101
My collection of what was done for Intro to Software Engineering at Carleton University. This course was solely written in C++. It was taught by Professor Christine Laurendeau. It taught me the basics and some advanced concepts in C++. The reason I have uploaded all the assingments is to let you as a viewer/employer have an idea of the developement I went through in extending this program. We were given almost full creative freedom as long as it followed certain guidelines (no memory leaks, bad coding practice, etc). 





#Assignment 1/A1

  The purpose for this assignment was to change all the already existing objects in the Bookstore Management System's base code present by Professor Christine Laurendeau, to dynamically allocated objects.
  
#Assignment 2/A2

  The purpose of this assignment was to implement a dynamically allocated doubly-linked list for the "Courses" section of the existing Bookstore Management Sytem. The add, remove and list features were to be implemented as that of a standard doubly-linked list, instead of the previous array-style setup of A1.
  
#Assignment 3/A3
  
  The purpose of this assignment was to add a new hierarchy based on an inheritence relationship, and overload operators in relation to the add, remove and print features of the bookstore management system.
  
#Assignment 4/A4

  The purpose of this assignment was to implement a totally new feature of our choosing. The new feature had to use inheritence, polymorphism and overloading of operators.
