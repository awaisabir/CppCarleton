# comp2404
My collection of what was done for COMP2404 (Intro to Software Engineering) at Carleton University. This course was solely written in C++. It was taught by Professor Christine Laurendeau. It taught me the basics and some advanced concepts in C++. Feel free to look at my projects.

  All projects were made according to the instructions of our professor, and the sample code was given for A1. Rest of the assignments were worked on by myself.
