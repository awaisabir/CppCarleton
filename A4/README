OUR FEATURE MIMICS THE REGULAR TRANSACTIONS THAT GO ON IN A BOOKSTORE
WE HAVE: ~ BUYING PRODUCTS -> GETS THE PRODUCT INFO, REMOVES IT FROM THE PRODUCT ARRAY & 				   					  CALCULATES THE CHANGE THAT IS DUE ON THE PURSCHASE.

		 ~ RESERVING A PRODUCT -> GETS THE PRODUCT INFO, AND RESERVES THAT PRODUCT

		 ~ RETURNING A PRODUCT -> GETS THE PRODUCT INFO , ADDS IT TO THE PRODUCT ARRAY & 								CALCULATES THE REFUND ON THAT PRODUCT

		 ~ RENTING A BOOK  -> ALLOWS THE RENTING OF A BOOK FOR SOME AMOUNT OF TIME

	THE BASE ABSTRACT CLASS IS CALLED TRANSACTION. IT CONTAINS A PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION CALLED transactionHandle, WHICH RETURNS A STRING WHICH IS PRINTED ONTO THE CONSOLE FOR THE USER TO SEE. EACH CLASS' FUNCTION IS DOCUMENTED IN EACH HEADER FILE. THE transactionHandle FUNCTION IS CALLED IN OPTION #15, WHERE IT ALSO REMOVES AND ADDS EVERYTHING IF A BUY/RETURN OPTION HAS BEEN CHOSEN. 



COMPILATION:

- MOVE TO THE SPECIFIED FOLDER IN TERMINAL
